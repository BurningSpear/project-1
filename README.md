Description

This project is about programming a card memory game. The game is programmed using Hypertext Markup Language - html, Cascading Style Sheets – CSS and JavaScript.
The game is played by a single player at a time. The player will start by flipping a card and when the next card flipped is not a match to the first flipped, both cards get automatically flipped back to hidden.
The player will again flip a card until all matching cards are found and the game displays a message of congratulations to the user.
At the moment, there is a total number of 16 Cards but this number might increase with upcoming versions and the so as to make the game more challenging.
