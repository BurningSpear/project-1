Description

This project is about programming a card memory game. The game is programmed using Hypertext Markup Language - html, Cascading Style Sheets – CSS and JavaScript.
The game is played by a single player at a time. The player will start by flipping a card and when the next card flipped is not a match to the first flipped, both cards get automatically flipped back to hidden.
The player will again flip a card until all matching cards are found and the game displays a message of congratulations to the user.
At the moment, there is a total number of 16 Cards but this number might increase with upcoming versions and the so as to make the game more challenging.

Technical Requirements
Your game must:
•	Render in the browser
Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
Add here the initial template with both css and js file links.
•	Use JavaScript for DOM manipulation
•	Be deployed online, using Github Project pages and/or to a custom domain.
•	Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
•	Show a good commit history with frequent commits
Additionally, your project should stick with KISS (Keep It Stupid Simple) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
